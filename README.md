Fortoresse XY is a free world, 2D shooter multiplayer game in early development.

## Origins

Fortoresse XY has its roots from the original Fortoresse game by the Atelier 801 company. There are several differences planned:

* Crossing endpoints of a level would lead to another level.
* Pixel buildings would be substituted by higher buildings, such as breakable shields and slopes.

Planned features:

* Native servers
* User servers
  * Scripting

## Environment variables

For the client side project, do the following steps:

* Copy the **.env-example.txt** file into a new **.env.txt** file.
* Assign the environment variables in that .env.txt file properly.

For each of the server side projects, do the following steps:

* Copy the **.env-example** file into a new **.env** file.
* Assign the environment variables in that .env file properly.

## Client side

The client side is currently beginning and uses:

* [Samsung HARMAN AIR](https://airsdk.dev)
  * AIR supports native WebSocket as of 2024. [Download AIR SDK 51.0.](https://airsdk.harman.com/download/51.0.0.2)
* [Feathers UI](https://feathersui.com) â€” OpenFL SWC for ActionScript 3

Expected tools:

* Adobe Animate for graphics assets.

<!--

Client side reconsiderations:

* No use of Apache Flex or Apache Royale, given that both are not priorized over the Feathers UI project by Josh Tynjala. The reason is that Josh builds a SWC for every Feathers UI release, which is compatible with AIR applications written in ActionScript 3.
* If the project were to use Apache Flex, then the AIR SDK overlay would be overlaid into the Apache Flex SDK.

Requirements:

* AIR SDK
* Node.js
* Install `asconfigc` through the command `npm i -g asconfigc`

Debug the client through the following commands:

* Windows: Command Prompt

```batch
run\debug-client
```

* Unix Shell

```bash
./run/debug-client.sh
```

## Database

The HTTP server side is responsible for communicating with the Fortoresse XY's database. It is oriented to MySQL, but may use any other data source provider.

* Install [Apache XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org) for local debugging, which provides a MySQL installation in hands and phpMyAdmin for MySQL database management.
* Initial XAMPP MySQL database URL: `mysql://root@localhost:3306/fortoressexy`.
* Public MySQL database URL: `mysql://username:password@host.com:port/fortoressexy`.
* The HTTP server side project uses the [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm).

## Server side

Run the server through the following commands:

* Windows: Command Prompt

```batch
run\run-server
```

* Unix Shell

```bash
./run/run-server.sh
```

### Socket server side

The socket server side is launched when a server is instantiated by at least one player. The list of active socket servers is managed by the HTTP server side.

The socket server side uses Node.js and is still beginning.
